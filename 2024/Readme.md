# AOC 2024

This year I will again be building the solutions in Purescript.

The input files should be supplied via files called `dayX.txt` with X being the number of the corresponding day.

See [this getting started guide](https://github.com/purescript/documentation/blob/master/guides/Getting-Started.md) for setup details.

1. Install node, purescript and spago
2. Run `spago run`
