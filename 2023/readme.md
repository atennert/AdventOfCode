# AOC 2023

This year I will again be building the solution in Kotlin. However, unlike in the last years, I will not make use of KScript, but instead I will use the brand new [Kotlin Notebooks](https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2023/07/introducing-kotlin-notebook/).

As usual, the input should be supplied via a file called `input.txt`.
